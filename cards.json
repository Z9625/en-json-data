        "about": "The Kukeldash Madrasah is one of the most renowned historical buildings in the city of Tashkent. This madrasah was constructed and put into operation by Dervishkhan, a representative of the Shaybanid dynasty, during 1551-75, over a period of 24 years. Therefore, the madrasah is also called the ‘Dervishkhana’ madrasah. \n\n The Kukeldash Madrasah was built next to the mosque of Khoja Ahror Vali, one of the first mosques in Tashkent, in accordance with traditional Eastern architecture. The madrasah is located on Shahriston hill. Originally, the madrasah had three floors. The left wing of the madrasah served as a mosque, while the right wing was used as classrooms. \n\n The Kukeldash Madrasah was severely damaged in the 60-70s of the 19th century during the period of ‘Russian invasion’ of Tashkent. In 1886, as a result of the reconstruction of cells and the cathedral mosque by Russian engineers, it completely lost its original architectural appearance. Years later, it suffered significant damage from earthquakes. At the beginning of the 20th century, repair work was carried out through charitable donations from the population of Tashkent, but the work soon ceased. \n\n Restoration and repair work conducted until 1996 was mainly carried out through public donations. Since 1996, repair work has been conducted with the help of construction materials allocated by the city hokim for Tashkent's renovation, as well as through donations received by the Office of Muslims of Uzbekistan and the madrasah. During the independence period's repair work, significant contributions were made by Bukharan Ahror Asqarov and the engineer from the Institute of Monument Protection of the Ministry of Culture, author of the construction project of the ‘Kukeldash’ madrasah and master restorer Mirobid Mirzoakhmedov. \n\n Currently, the Kukeldash Madrasah provides Islamic education, Arabic and Persian grammar, as well as various other religious teachings. \n\n On one of the inner walls of the madrasah, one can see an inscription similar to the ancient Roman saying ‘Ars longa - vita brevia’: ‘Death is inevitable, but the creation made by man remains eternal’.",

        "p": "Afrosiyob was founded in the 8th–7th centuries BC in the northeastern part of present-day Samarkand. It was the capital of Sogdiana until it was destroyed in the 13th century during the Mongol invasion.",
        "about": "Afrasiyab is considered the ancient centre of Samarkand. The ruins of Afrasiyab are located in the north-east of Samarkand, approximately 10-15 metres above the city. The city is mentioned in ancient sources as ‘Smaracanda’.   In the 4th century AD, after Alexander the Great conquered Samarkand, it was mentioned in Greek sources as Marokanda. Marokanda is the Greek translation of Smaragand. When the Samanids came to power in Mawarannahr, ancient Smaragand began to be called Samarkand in the 9th century.  \n\n In the 11th-15th centuries, Samarkand was mentioned in Turkish literature as Semizkent. From the 15th century, the name Samarkand began to be used in Persian and Turkish sources. \n\n There is very little information about the early history of the city in written sources. However, archaeological excavations in the old city provide more information. \n Archaeological materials found in Afrosiab indicate that Samarkand existed as the central city of Sogdiana in the 8th-5th centuries BC. In 329 BC, the city was destroyed by the troops of Alexander the Great, traces of which are still well preserved in the city fortifications. In the 3rd-1st centuries BC, during the reign of the Kushan dynasty, the city experienced a period of prosperity. In the 3rd century BC, the city was surrounded by a defensive rampart. The remains of this rampart are well preserved in the northern part of Afrosiyab, where its ruins are located. According to archaeological materials and written sources, during this period, the Great Silk Road passed through Samarkand, and internal and external trade and crafts flourished. In the early Middle Ages, Samarkand became the capital of Sugdiongan and occupied an influential position, undergoing radical changes in the social and economic life of the city. The power of the Badavlat-Dekhons grew stronger, and at the same time, the northern part of Afrosiab, where their palaces were located, was surrounded by defensive walls. The same situation developed in Mawarannux and neighbouring provinces. During this period, the rulers of Samarkand were called ‘Ihshid,’ and the rulers of Bukhara were called ‘Bukhorkhudot.’ In 712, when the Arabs arrived, led by Kutayba ibn Muslim, the defensive walls of Samarkand were strong, and there was a moat around them. Kutayba defeated the armies of Fergana, Shosh and the Turks who came to the aid of Samarkand, and the ruler of Sughd, Gurak, left without support, was forced to surrender the inner part of the city (shahriston) to the Arabs. Archaeological finds prove that statues and frescoes depicting Islam were destroyed with axes. \n\n On 13 July 1966, the government of the republic adopted a special decision to organise a comprehensive archaeological study of Afrosiyab. \nArchaeological research based on precise scientific methods has revealed not only the long history of the city, but also its historical topography in different periods, the structure of the city, the stages of its development, and the periods of prosperity that followed the invasions. The royal palace of the rulers of Samarkand was opened to visitors."

        "p": "The Ashratkhona Mausoleum is located in the old part of Samarkand, near Registan, and was built in 1464 during the Timurid era, in the time of Amir Temur's grandson, Mirzo Ulughbek.",
        "about": "The Ashratkhona Mausoleum is located on the outskirts of the old city of Samarkand and is considered an architectural monument of Samarkand. Until recently, it was known as 'Ishratkhona', but researchers from the Samarkand State Museum-Reserve emphasize that its original name was 'Ashratkhona' (meaning 'ten rooms' in Arabic-Persian) and that the name had changed in pronunciation over time. The name 'Ashratkhona' was also given conditionally, connected to the political crisis that occurred in the Bukhara Khanate in the 18th century. During that time, wars between tribes and repeated invasions caused a plague outbreak, leading the population to abandon Samarkand. In the era of Emir Shohmurod of Bukhara, when Samarkand was rebuilt, settlers from different regions, lacking complete knowledge, gave ancient monuments names of their own. The 'Samariya' work, written in the 1830s, mentions the Ashratkhona Mausoleum. Based on the work, it can be said that this mausoleum was fully constructed in 1963 on the orders of Habiba Sultan for her daughter, Sultan Hovandbeka. Later, it became a dynastic tomb where 23 women and children were buried. After the Timurids lost power and the Shaybanids came, mausoleums and madrasahs related to the dynasty were neglected. This neglect continued during the Russian Empire and Soviet Union periods, leaving it to fall into ruin. For example, during the 1897 earthquake, the mausoleum suffered severe damage, and in 1902 its dome collapsed."

        "p": "Have you ever seen a mausoleum without a grave 100 meter above the city Samarkand? Why do we need mausoleums ?",
        "about": "Generally, notable figures and people of great influence such as kings, khans, and generals are buried in mausoleums. However, the Chupanata Mausoleum is different from the others. Located 824 meters above sea level, it offers a breathtaking view of Samarkand city. During archaeological excavations, swords and pieces of armor were found here. The most interesting fact is that this building contains no burial at all! Soil from this site was used to build the foundation of the conqueror Amir Temur's mausoleum, Gur-e Amir. Later, Ulugh Beg constructed his observatory around it. Some sources claim that this building even served as a beacon."
